# Lab 8
## Data Analysis
> *I pledge my Honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*

After studying Lesson 6, I have provided below some snapshots of my experimentation with some data analysis capabilities that python3 can deliver, through use of histograms, charts including time series, and a scatter plot with a linear trednline, based on the CPU data we gathered from the previous lab (lab 8). One setback with the way this lab was done was that not enough trials were ran from running the cpu data simulation from last time, so there isn't as much desired consistency to full represent the data analysis visuals provided below.
