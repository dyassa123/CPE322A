# Lab 5
## Paho-MQTT
> *I pledge my Honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*

After studying Lesson 5, I have provided below some snapshots of my experimentation with Paho-MQTT. Honestly, I had trouble in the beginning, not realizing I had to install both the mosquitto-clients and mosquitto packages when running sudo commands after initally installing only the clients package having downloaded Mosquitto. I troubleshooted my connection errors by researching the issue online. I also had to install the psutil library when running the CPU usage commands on my two terminals, as demonstrated below.
