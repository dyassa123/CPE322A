# CPE322A, *Engineering Design VI*
## **Spring 2023**
> In this course, I plan to take my problem formulation and computer engineering capabilities to the next level.

Some basic git commands that I will be using throughout this course and beyond:

```
git status
git add
git commit

```
My preferred colors to use in this class when it comes to writing source code would be:
- #ADD8E6 (Light Blue)
- #90EE90 (Light Green)
