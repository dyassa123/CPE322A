# Lab 10
## Blockchain
> *I pledge my Honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*

After studying Lesson 10, I gained a more in-depth analysis of how python is used in a secure transaction network otherwise known as blockchain. In this lab, I discovered how to generate hash values, snakecoin and how less than 50 lines of python was used to create this tiny blockchain, mining a new block, as well as a blockchain app that was derived from another repository. 

## Comparing Two Hash Values

The hash values for Python differ by a significant amount, a shown above. The hash for an object of person is also different, however for the first iteration he hash for a tuple of vowels is poisitive whereas the other one is negative.
