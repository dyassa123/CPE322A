# Lab 7
## ThingSpeak and Google Sheets
> *I pledge my Honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*

After studying Lesson 7, I have provided below some snapshots of my experimentation with Cloud Platforms, including but not limited to ThingSpeak, Google Cloud Platform (JSON key), and Python3 capabilities. Because I do not have a Raspberry Pi on me, I used the cpudata steps for my project.
