# Lab 4
## Django and Flask
> *I pledge my Honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*

After studying Lesson 4 in the Github repository and gaining insight on the Django and Django REST frameworks as well as the SQLite database, I have provided below some snapshots of my experimentation with them when making my own project and running it on a server. I received errors running the stevens and cpudata projects, but my efforts were successful up until I had to run the Django server However, I did have success running Flask as I already had the module installed on my WSL beforehand.
